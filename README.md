“Bug Report Automation Tool ========================== This project is a bug report automation tool that integrates with Jira to facilitate the creation of bug reports. It consists of two main files: * `index.py` * `jira2.py` Overview -------- * **index.py**: This is the main GUI application using PyQt5. It provides a user interface for entering bug report details and interacts with Jira to create issues automatically. * **jira2.py**: This script handles interactions with Jira using Selenium for web automation. It includes functions to start a Chrome WebDriver and automate the creation of issues on a Jira dashboard. Requirements ------------ * Python 3.x * PyQt5 * Selenium * chromedriver-autoinstaller * Google Chrome browser installed Setup and Installation ---------------------- 1. **Install Python dependencies**: bash 코드 복사 `pip install PyQt5 selenium chromedriver-autoinstaller requests` 2. **Download Google Chrome**: Ensure that Google Chrome is installed on your system. 3. **Set up the Chrome WebDriver**: The script uses `chromedriver-autoinstaller` to automatically download and set up the correct version of Chrome WebDriver. Usage ----- ### Starting the Application Run the `index.py` file to launch the GUI application: bash 코드 복사 `python index.py` ### Features #### `index.py` - GUI Application * **User Interface**: Provides a form to enter bug report details such as summary, reviewer, branch, build, version, component, label, priority, severity, prevalence, and reproduction rate. * **Preset Management**: Load, save, and apply presets for different bug reporting scenarios. * **Automated Bug Report Creation**: Automates the process of creating bug reports in Jira using the `jira2` module. * **Description Generation**: Auto-generates the description based on the provided summary. * **Execute Button**: When clicked, it calls the `create_issue` function in `jira2.py` to create a bug report in Jira. #### `jira2.py` - Jira Automation Script * **Start WebDriver**: Starts a Chrome WebDriver session. If Chrome is not running, it launches a new instance with remote debugging enabled. * **Create Jira Issue**: Automates the creation of an issue in Jira using Selenium to fill in the necessary fields and submit the form. ### Notes * **Chrome Setup**: The application uses a specific Chrome user data directory (`C:\ChromeTEMP`) and the Chrome executable path (`C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe`). Ensure these paths are correctly set up on your system. * **Jira URL**: The default Jira URL used in the `create_issue` function is `https://jira.krafton.com/secure/Dashboard.jspa`. Update this URL to match your Jira instance if necessary. Troubleshooting --------------- * **Connection Errors**: Ensure that Chrome is installed and accessible at the specified path. If you encounter a connection error, make sure that no other Chrome instance is running on the remote debugging port (9222). * **Missing Dependencies**: Ensure all required Python packages are installed.
